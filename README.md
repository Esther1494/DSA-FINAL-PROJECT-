## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The raw dataset required several cleaning steps, all completed in Excel:

1. **Removed blank rows, duplicates, and inconsistent text formats**
2. **Created derived fields**, including:
   - `Discount %` = `(Original Price - Discounted Price) / Original Price`
   - `Rating Bucket` = grouped into *Excellent*, *Good*, *Average*, *Poor*
   - `Review-to-Product Ratio` = proxy for engagement
3. **Standardized product categories and currency formats**
4. Used **conditional formatting** to highlight anomalies (e.g., zero ratings with high reviews)

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

| Insight | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ⭐ **Top-Rated Products** | Mostly had moderate discounts (10–25%), indicating value-price sweet spot |
| 🚨 **Heavily Discounted Products** | (>40%) had lower average ratings, suggesting quality concerns or overstock issues |
| 📦 **High Engagement Categories** | Electronics and home goods had the most customer reviews |
| 📈 **Revenue Opportunity** | Mid-priced products ($25–$75) had the highest review volume and ratings—ideal for upselling |
| 🧩 **Category Gaps** | Some high-rated categories had low review volumes—potential under-marketed segments |
