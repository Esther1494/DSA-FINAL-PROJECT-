# Data Analysis Project: Amazon Reviews & KMS Inventory views

 Welcome to my data analysis project repository! This project combines two case studies to showcase the use of **SQL**, **Excel**, **Pivot Tables**, and **Dashboard Design** to derive practicable business insights from raw data.

 ## Project Overview

 This project includes two case studies:
 
1. **Amazon Product Review Analysis**  
2. **Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) Inventory Analysis**

Both case studies are designed to demonstrate my skills in:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Business intelligence
- Dashboard creation
- SQL querying and reporting

## üìä Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis
